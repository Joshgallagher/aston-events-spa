# Aston Events SPA

This piece of coursework was awarded **100%** - the SPA is only responsible for 10% of the overall make - as specified by the mark scheme.

For my Internet *Applications and Techniques* module I was tasked with building an events system for Aston University. This system allowed students to organise and find events happening at Aston.

The front-end was built with Vue.js - ***It is not perfect as does not follow good programming and software development patterns - we was not given a mark for the front-end code and design, but only the interface.*** However, this is not a true representation of my Vue.js skills :)

Check out the [RESTful API](https://github.com/Joshgallagher/aston-events-api) (responsible for 90% of the awarded mark).
For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
